Written concept of what you plan to do:

I am going to make an imaginary store website that sells chocolate. It will be a local store called Marlie's Magic Morsels.
I plan to have a map showing where the physical stores are located and a contact/order form that allows people to get an order
shipped to thier home. I am going to make it mobile friendly so that you can look at the different offerings easily and contact
the store as well. 
I created a website concept and a mobile design concept as well. I am hoping to be able to add all the functionality that I have originally
designed for including the tab section to show different chocolates, the differnt location maps, and a link to the blog I 
created for the servers and hosting class (wordpress.marliemagic.com). I still need to do some work to come up with an order
form final idea and validation for it, but I want to try to have unique order forms for at least two different items and hopefully
have them show up in modals. 


List of third party libraries or modules you plan to use:

I plan to use JQuery including Form Validation, Bootstrap, and Leaflet to create the site outlined in my description above!
